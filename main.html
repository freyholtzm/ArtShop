    <h2>Welcome to The Art Shop</h2>
    <p>The Art Shop is a shop available to everyone to buy prints, posters, or          basically just about anything!
      <br>
      <br> Artists from around the world sell their artworks on our site, and             people like you can buy just about anything they create. Want a                 personalized sketchbook? We got you covered. Want a print of your               favorite artist's watercolor piece? We have that
          too. Want a last minute Halloween or Chrismas decoration for you                living room? We also have those.
      <br>
      <br> At The Art Shop, everything we sell is handmade with that artist's blood, sweat, and tears.</p>
